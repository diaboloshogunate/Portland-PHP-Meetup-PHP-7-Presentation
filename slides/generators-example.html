<h2>Generators - What are they?</h2>
<p>A generator allows you to write code that uses foreach to iterate over a set of data without needing to build an array in memory</p>
<p>A generator function looks just like a normal function, except that instead of returning a value, a generator yields as many values as it needs to.</p>
<p>
    For example, calling range(0, 1000000) will result in well over 100 MB of memory being used.
    As an alternative, we can implement an xrange() generator,
    which will only ever need enough memory to create an Iterator object and track the current state of the generator internally,
    which turns out to be less than 1 kilobyte.
